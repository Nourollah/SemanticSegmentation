## A toolbox for image segmentation
In this repository I created a notebook that can be load in google colaboratory and run the code. 
The notebook is called `SegmentationLab.ipynb`. The notebook proposed GUI settings in colab.

Tensorboard and W&B are supported in the notebook. However, more monitoring tools that support by MMCV can be added.
